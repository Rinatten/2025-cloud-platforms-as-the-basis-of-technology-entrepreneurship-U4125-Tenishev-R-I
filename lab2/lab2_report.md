Ok, we created a "Hellow world" service that...well, places the words "Hello world". So, we created it in the cloud run platform:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/366cd6ec-e4c1-41e5-8728-465f8a0b5c2a)

Ok, but, for some reason it shows me this. I tried to see my service through the console and changed the settings, but it still shows me this and wants me to give them my adress and my card number and bank account... ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e711b0-bff1-4c1e-9b72-0b8334a9766c)

Ok, nevertheless, my logs show me this: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/302b0706-a4b6-425e-8936-867a15ddfef5)
Metrics are also working correctly, if I am not mistaken ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95d9a411-2851-48bc-b45e-8aabd110f399)

After that I changed the port to 8090 and it stopped working.
