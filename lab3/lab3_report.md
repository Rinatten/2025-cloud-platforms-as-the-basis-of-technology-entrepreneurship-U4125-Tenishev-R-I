Ok, so, in Cloud Storage I created a bucket named "rtenishev-lab3". I uploaded some qr codes from my business project on it: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f614f2-ab76-4f38-9eda-c9e5fd431a4d)

After that I created a folder and moved the codes' images in there:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8929d3-4cd9-4da5-928e-4544a7dcfb82)

And after I granted public access to all users: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e9d5d29-e717-43e0-a2f1-39296f79ca09)

Ta-da! I can open my pictures through other accounts if I have a URL! ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/544428fc-a56e-43e4-aa38-bdd97735c7ae)
